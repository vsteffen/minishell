# minishell
42 School project. From the subject (also available in french):

> Through the Minishell project, you will get to the core of the Unix system and explore an important part of this system’s API: process creation and synchronisation. Executing a command inside a shell implies creating a new process, which execution and final state will be monitored by its parent’s process. This set of functions will be the key to success for your Minishell, so be sure to code the cleanest, simplest program possible. Otherwise, you’ll probably have to start from scratch for your 21sh project and that would be a real shame.
>
> Be rigorous and methodical in your C coding, take the necessary time to read and understand the mans, but most importantly, test your code!
